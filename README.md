Finding things in Dev-mode can sometimes be tricky as the buttons has a fixed text-width.
Mods often has a prefix to their definitions causing many buttons show the same text, forcing trial and error to find the right one.

This mod adds a tooltip with the label-text for all buttons in the dev-mode windows whenever the text does not fit the button.
